# Story Improvement Documents (SIPs)

The goal of the SIP project is to standardize and provide high-quality
documentation for Story and its ecosystem. This repository tracks past and
ongoing improvements to Story in the form of Story Improvement Documents
(SIPs).
[SIP-0001](https://github.com/piplabs/SIPs/blob/main/proposals/0001-simd-process.md)
governs the SIP process.

## SIP Types

SIPs can be divided into the following categories:

- **Standard SIPs**:
  Describe changes that affect most or all Story implementations, such as:
  - **Core**:
    Changes affecting consensus or substantial changes to the validator.
  - **Networking**:
    Changes or substantial improvements to network protocol specifications.
  - **Interfaces**:
    Breaking changes around the client JSON RPC API specifications and standards.
- **Meta SIPs**:
  Describe a process surrounding Story or propose a change to (or an event in)
  a process. For example, specify the changes included in a hardfork.

## Before You Begin

Before you write a SIP, ideas MUST be thoroughly discussed and vetted on the
[ideas section](https://github.com/piplabs/SIPs/discussions/categories/ideas)
within this
[repo's disucssion page](https://github.com/piplabs/SIPs/discussions).
Read and review [SIP-0001](https://github.com/piplabs/SIPs/blob/main/proposals/0001-simd-process.md),
which describes the SIP process in detail.

This repository is for documenting standards and not for implementation help.
For specific questions and concerns regarding SIPs, it's best to discuss them
in the [questions section](https://github.com/piplabs/SIPs/discussions/categories/questions)
of this [repo's disucssion page](https://github.com/piplabs/SIPs/discussions).

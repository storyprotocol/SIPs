# Story Improvement Proposals (SIPs)

This repository is the home of all the Story Improvement 
Proposals (SIPs), standards, guidelines and recommendations for 
the Story network and its broader ecosystem. It enables the 
community to propose and track improvements, 
building the future of the Story and its ecosystem —one SIP at a 
time.

## How To Start A SIP

Well! A SIP doesn’t start from this repo, every SIP starts as an 
idea first shared with the community through [the Story's 
community forum](https://forum.story.foundation/), and after 
thorough 
discussion and attracting support it can then be converted 
int a SIP draft. please refer to 
[SIP-00001](https://github.com/piplabs/SIPs/blob/main/proposals/00001-sip-process.md)
 for more details.

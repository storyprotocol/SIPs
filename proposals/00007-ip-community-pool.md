## Summary

The proposal titled "Establishing the IP Community Pool" suggests 
allocating 5% of the network's annual inflation to a newly created IP 
Community Pool. This pool aims to distribute rewards to key ecosystem 
participants, including IP 
 creators, decentralized application (dApp) developers, and small validators, 
 based on on-chain metrics. The specific distribution mechanisms will 
 be determined by the Story Foundation's governance framework.

## Motivation

Staking rewards represent the networkâ€™s inflation mechanism, designed to
 incentivize validators and the broader community for securing and expanding
  the ecosystem. Currently, 100% of network inflation is allocated to token
   stakers in recognition of their role in bootstrapping the network.

The protocol already supports directing a portion of inflation to a separate
 pool contract on the execution client. Initially, this mechanism was designed
  as a Universal Basic Income (UBI) contract, distributing tokens to validators
 based on participation rather than stake size. This design aimed to ensure
 smaller validators received sufficient rewards to cover operational and
 infrastructure costs. However, the allocation rate for this pool is 
 currently set at 0%.

## Proposal

This proposal recommends allocating 5% of network inflation to a newly 
designated IP Community Pool (formerly the UBI Pool). This pool will 
programmatically distribute rewards based on on-chain metrics to 
support key ecosystem participants, such as IP creators, dApp developers, 
and small validators. The precise distribution mechanism will be determined 
by the Story Foundation in accordance with its governance framework.

At the current inflation rate of 20 million tokens per year, this 
allocation would reserve 1 million tokens annually for the IP Community Pool.

### Rationale

- Diversified Incentives: Expanding incentives beyond stakers fosters
 a more balanced and sustainable ecosystem.

- Ecosystem Growth: Supporting IP creators and developers enhances
 network utility and adoption.

- Long-Term Sustainability: This approach complements the initial 10% 
foundation token allocation, ensuring ongoing ecosystem development rather 
than relying solely on upfront grants.

By implementing this change, the protocol can better align incentives with 
long-term ecosystem health while maintaining a fair and transparent reward structure.

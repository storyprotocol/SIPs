## Summary

This SIP propose increasing the reward boosts when community
 members decides to stake and secure the network for a longer 
 time windown. 

[forum discussion link](https://forum.story.foundation/t/proposal-update-staking-rewards-boosters/552)

## Motivation

The current staking reward multiplier structure is as follows:

- Flexible staking: 1.0x
- 90-day fixed staking: 1.051x
- 360-day fixed staking: 1.16x
- 540-day fixed staking: 1.34x
- Locked token staking: 0.5x

These multipliers were initially designed based on the 
compounding effect of rewards, with a slight bias toward 
incentivizing long-term staking. However, given the current 
inflation rate and competitive staking models in the crypto 
market, the existing structure may not provide sufficient 
incentives for long-term commitment.

## Proposal

We propose updating the staking reward multipliers to the 
following structure:

- Flexible staking: 1.0x
- 90-day fixed staking: 1.1x
- 360-day fixed staking: 1.5x
- 540-day fixed staking: 2.0x
- Locked token staking: 0.5x

This revision aims to significantly enhance incentives for 
long-term stakers while maintaining a balanced reward 
distribution. The proposed adjustments provide a more 
substantial differentiation between short-term and long-term 
commitments, aligning with industry best practices to attract 
and retain committed stakeholders.

### Rationale

- Enhanced Long-Term Staking Incentives: The updated 
multipliers offer a more compelling reward structure for 
stakers willing to lock their tokens for extended periods, 
promoting network security and stability.

- Competitive Positioning: The revised staking model ensures 
that our staking mechanism remains competitive in the 
evolving crypto landscape, where higher multipliers for 
long-term staking are becoming more common.

- Inflation Neutrality: This proposal does not alter the 
overall token emission rate or inflation ratio, ensuring that 
the total supply dynamics remain unaffected while improving 
reward efficiency.

## Abstract

Provide a concise technical summary of the proposal in 2-3 sentences. This should be understandable to someone familiar with the Story Protocol ecosystem but not necessarily the specific problem domain.

## Summary

Provide a brief summary of this proposal and why it's needed. Keep it concise—details should be provided in the below sections.

Include links to relevant community discussion threads, Discord conversations, or forum posts.

## Motivation

### Problem Statement
Does this proposal address an existing problem or create new opportunities?

If addressing a problem:
- Who are the affected users (developers, validators, end users, etc.)?
- Why is it problematic?
- What data or evidence supports this assessment?
- What is the current workaround, if any?

If creating opportunities:
- What new capabilities does this enable?
- What is the potential impact on the ecosystem?

### Success Criteria
- What defines a successful solution?
- What are concrete use cases that benefit from this solution?
- What metrics will be used to measure success?

### Scope and Non-Goals
- What is explicitly in scope for this proposal?
- What related issues are intentionally out of scope?

## New Terminology (optional)

Define any new terms, concepts, or terminology introduced by this proposal.

## Specification

This section explains in detail the proposed changes and how they work. Use RFC 2119 keywords ("MUST", "SHOULD", "MAY", etc.) where appropriate.

### Technical Design

Provide detailed technical specifications including:
- Protocol changes
- API modifications
- Data structures
- Message formats
- State transitions

### Implementation Requirements

What are the key requirements any implementation must satisfy?

### Reference Implementation (optional)

Provide pseudocode, algorithms, or implementation sketches where helpful.

## Rationale and Design Decisions

### Alternatives Considered

List alternatives you considered but rejected, explaining why your chosen approach is superior:
- Alternative A: Description, pros, cons, why rejected
- Alternative B: Description, pros, cons, why rejected

### Design Trade-offs

What trade-offs does this design make and why?

### Drawbacks

Why should this *not* be done? What negative impacts might it have?

## Impact Analysis

### User Impact

- What changes will end users experience?
- How will this affect different user personas (developers, validators, IP creators, etc.)?
- What is the migration path for existing users?

### Developer Impact

- How does this affect SDK development?
- What new APIs or tools are needed?
- How will this impact existing development workflows?

### Network Impact

- How does this affect network topology, traffic patterns, or resource usage?
- What are the implications for network upgrades and governance?

### Economic Impact (optional if not applicable)

- Does this change economic incentives or token economics?
- What are the cost implications for different network participants?
- How might this affect network value accrual?

## Compatibility

### Backward Compatibility

- Is this change backward compatible?
- If not, what is the migration strategy?
- How will legacy systems be supported?

### Forward Compatibility

- How does this design accommodate future enhancements?
- What extensibility mechanisms are provided?

### Ecosystem Integration

- How will this work with existing tools and infrastructure?
- What changes are needed in wallets, explorers, SDKs?
- How does this interact with other protocols in the ecosystem?

## Security Considerations

- What are the security implications of this change?
- What new attack vectors might be introduced?
- How are these risks mitigated?
- What security assumptions does this make?
- Are there any cryptographic considerations?

## Performance Implications (optional)

### Computational Impact
- Expected changes in CPU usage, memory consumption
- Gas cost implications for smart contracts
- Benchmarking methodology

### Network Impact
- Bandwidth requirements
- Latency implications
- Scalability considerations

### Storage Impact
- State growth implications
- Archive node requirements

## Implementation Plan

### Development Phases

Break down implementation into logical phases:
1. Phase 1: Core implementation
2. Phase 2: Integration and testing
3. Phase 3: Deployment and migration

### Testing Strategy

- Unit testing approach
- Integration testing requirements
- Network testing on testnets
- Security auditing requirements

### Deployment Strategy

- Rollout phases (testnet → mainnet)
- Feature flags or gradual activation
- Monitoring and rollback procedures

### Maintenance

- Who will maintain this code?
- What ongoing operational requirements exist?
- How will this be monitored and debugged?

## Documentation and Examples

### Tutorial and Usage Examples

Provide end-to-end examples showing:
- How developers will use new features
- Integration patterns
- Common use cases

The examples should be written as user-facing documentation, not internal technical specs.

### Migration Guide (optional - required only for breaking changes)

If this changes existing functionality, provide:
- Step-by-step migration instructions
- Code examples showing before/after
- Timeline for deprecation of old methods

## Community Consensus

### Discussion Summary

Document community feedback and discussions:
- Links to [forum discussions](https://forum.story.foundation/), Discord conversations
- Summary of key feedback themes
- How feedback was incorporated into the design

### Stakeholder Impact

- Which stakeholders are most affected?
- What is their level of support or concern?
- How were conflicts resolved?

### Governance Considerations

- What governance mechanisms are needed for adoption?
- Are there any voting or consensus requirements?
- How will this be coordinated with other network upgrades?

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies

- Does this require changes to other components?
- What external libraries or systems are needed?
- Are there version compatibility requirements?

### Process Dependencies

- What other SIPs must be implemented first?
- Are there coordination requirements with other teams?
- What approvals or reviews are needed?

## Related Work (optional)

### Prior Art

- Have other networks implemented similar features?
- What can we learn from their experience?
- How does this approach differ from existing solutions?

### Future Work

- What related improvements could build on this?
- What issues are intentionally deferred to future proposals?
